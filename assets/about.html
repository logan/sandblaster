    <h1>About Sand Blaster</h1>

    <b>Sand Blaster</b> simulates falling particles like sand, water, and other elements in two dimensions.

    <h2>Controls</h2>

    <p>
      At the bottom of the screen, you'll find a <i>palette</i> containing squares for each of the types
      of elements that you can draw with. The currently selected element will have a white border around it.
      Touch one of these squares to select it as the current drawing element.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you touch any other part of the screen, you will insert a particle of the currently selected element.
      Hold down or drag your finger tip to continuously insert particles. If you hold your finger on the same pixel for more than
      half a second and then release, then the same element will continuously be inserted in the same location forever until
      you draw over it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cost of simulating and rendering particles is proportional to the number of particles on the screen. For this reason,
      the application defaults to a low resolution. Choosing <i>Smaller</i> from the menu will increase the resolution, at the expense
      of frame rate and batter power. Choosing <i>Bigger</i> will decrease the resolution.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Particles</h2>

    Each particle on the screen is of a particular element, which is represented by its color.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th colspan="2">Palette Elements</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="concrete">Concrete</td>
        <td>Concrete is static and blocks all particles. Use this element to create structures (like bowls) to hold other particles.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="sand">Sand</td>
        <td>Sand is one of the simplest and most dense particles. It is mobile but does not react with any elements.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="salt">Salt</td>
        <td>Salt is as dense as sand, but reacts to water and vegetation.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="water">Water</td>
        <td>
          Water is lighter than sand or salt. Salt turns water into salt water,
          and vegetation turns water into more vegetation. Over time, water will become salty due to evaporation.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="oil">Oil</td>
        <td>Oil is lighter than water and very flammable.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="vegetation">Vegetation</td>
        <td>
          Vegetation is static, but unlike concrete it is very reactive. Vegetation
          will turn water into more vegetation, but vegetation will be killed by salt and salt water. Vegetation also
          burns easily, and over time will die naturally.
        </td>
      <tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="fire">Fire</td>
        <td>Fire is a very buoyant and short-lived element. Fire will turn oil and live or dead vegetation into more fire.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th colspan="2">Other Elements</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="saltwater">Salt water</td>
        <td>Salt water is the heaviest liquid particle. Over time salt water will evaporate into salt.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="dead">Dead vegetation</td>
        <td>
          Dead vegetation is subject to movement and gravity, unlike live vegetation, and burns
          a little faster. Water can bring dead vegetation back to life.
        </td>
      </tr>
