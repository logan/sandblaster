    <h1>About Sand Blaster</h1>

    <b>Sand Blaster</b> simulates falling particles like sand, water, and other elements in two dimensions.

    <h2>Controls</h2>

    <p>
      Touch the screen in the canvas to draw particles with the currently selected element. The selected element
      comes from the <i>palette</i> below the canvas, which contains colored boxes labelled with element names.
      Touch one of these boxes to change the selected element.
    </p>

    <p>
      Use the zoom controls at the bottom of the screen to zoom in or out. Spin the trackball to pan your view of
      the canvas in any direction. You can recenter your view and restore the zoom level by clicking <tt>MENU</tt> and
      clicking on the <i>Zoom to fit</i> option.

    <h2>Types of Particles</h2>

    Each particle on the screen is of a particular element, which is represented by its color.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th colspan="2">Palette Elements</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="concrete">Concrete</td>
        <td>Concrete is static and blocks all particles. Use this element to create structures (like bowls) to hold other particles.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="sand">Sand</td>
        <td>Sand is one of the simplest and most dense particles. It is mobile but does not react with any elements.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="salt">Salt</td>
        <td>Salt is as dense as sand, but reacts to water and vegetation.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="water">Water</td>
        <td>
          Water is lighter than sand or salt. Salt turns water into salt water,
          and vegetation turns water into more vegetation. Over time, water will become salty due to evaporation.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="oil">Oil</td>
        <td>Oil is lighter than water and very flammable.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="vegetation">Vegetation</td>
        <td>
          Vegetation is static, but unlike concrete it is very reactive. Vegetation
          will turn water into more vegetation, but vegetation will be killed by salt and salt water. Vegetation also
          burns easily, and over time will die naturally.
        </td>
      <tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="fire">Fire</td>
        <td>Fire is a very buoyant and short-lived element. Fire will turn oil and live or dead vegetation into more fire.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th colspan="2">Other Elements</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="saltwater">Salt water</td>
        <td>Salt water is the heaviest liquid particle. Over time salt water will evaporate into salt.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="dead">Dead vegetation</td>
        <td>
          Dead vegetation is subject to movement and gravity, unlike live vegetation, and burns
          a little faster. Water can bring dead vegetation back to life.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Loading and Saving</h2>

    <p>
      You can save the state of your sandbox by clicking <tt>MENU</tt> and choosing the <i>Save</i> option.
