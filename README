ECLIPSE USERS

You should have the Android plugins installed in Eclipse already:

    http://code.google.com/android/intro/installing.html

There is a script in the eclipse subdirectory of this project that will
generate a project configuration for you to import into a new Eclipse project.
Just follow these steps:

1. Run eclipse/setup from this directory. This will create .project and
   .classpath files for importing into a new Eclipse project.
   Note: If this script doesn't work for you (e.g., you are in Windows), just
   copy eclipse/classpath.template to .classpath and eclipse/project.template
   to .project. Then, edit .project and do a global search and replace of
   "SRC" to the full path to this file.

2. In Eclipse, under the File menu, select "Import..."

3. Under General, select "Existing Projects into Workspace" and click "Next >".

4. Click the "Browse..." button next to "Select root directory."

5. Select the directory containing this file. The "SandActivity" project
   should appear in the list of projects now.

6. Check the "Copy projects into workspace" checkbox.

7. Click "Finish."

At this point the project should be imported. To launch an emulator running
the application:

1. Under Run, select "Run configurations..."

2. Double-click "Android Application".

3. Under "Project", click "Browse..." and choose the "SandActivity" project
   that you've just created.

4. Give the run configuration a name if you like.

5. Apply your changes, and click "Run" to start the emulator up.
